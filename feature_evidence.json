This applies to all locations where cases are fetched and supplied to views, including the Dashboard (DashboardView.tsx) and the Cases list page (CasesListView.tsx). The regression introduced in Version 97 caused cases to not appear in either view; the Version 93 approach must be restored so that cases load and render correctly.",
