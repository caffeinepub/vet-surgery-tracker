# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Improve the SurgiPaw Dashboard's patient cards with a more compact layout, species silhouette icons, relocate the "+ New Case" button to the header, and include completed cases in the New Case patient lookup search.

**Planned changes:**
- Reduce patient card size on the Dashboard (less padding, smaller fonts, reduced card height) so more cards are visible without scrolling
- Move the "+ New Case" button into the top navigation/header bar, positioned to the left of the Dashboard nav button, and remove it from its previous location
- Replace species text labels ("Canine", "Feline", "Other") on patient cards with colored animal silhouette icons: dog (amber/orange) for Canine, cat (teal/green) for Feline, and rabbit (lavender/purple) for Other
- Update the previous-case lookup in the New Case form to include cases where all tasks are completed, in addition to active/open cases

**User-visible outcome:** The Dashboard shows more compact patient cards with species icons instead of text labels, the "+ New Case" button is always accessible in the header, and searching for previous patients in the New Case form returns completed cases as well as active ones.
