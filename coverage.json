The only changes in Version 94 were to workflow/task icons and their associated logic. Compare the current frontend code for cases data fetching and rendering (useQueries.ts, CasesListView.tsx, DashboardView.tsx, CaseCard.tsx, ChecklistEditor.tsx, WorkflowIcon.tsx) against the last known working state to identify where the icon/workflow changes broke Cases loading. Restore Cases loading to the working state from Version 93 while keeping any valid icon improvements intact.",
