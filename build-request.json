      "id": "REQ-1",
      "text": "Revert the data-fetching logic for surgery cases in the frontend to the implementation from Version 93. This applies to all locations where cases are fetched and supplied to views, including the Dashboard (DashboardView.tsx) and the Cases list page (CasesListView.tsx). The regression introduced in Version 97 caused cases to not appear in either view; the Version 93 approach must be restored so that cases load and render correctly.",

    "Introducing new features or UI changes beyond restoring the Version 93 data-fetching behavior.",
    "Changing backend query endpoints or data schemas.",
    "Modifying immutable frontend paths such as useActor.ts, useInternetIdentity.ts, or main.tsx."
