  "summary": "The diff addresses the blank page issue primarily through frontend changes in useQueries.ts, bypassing the broken useActor hook by creating actors directly via createActorWithConfig. REQ-2 and REQ-3 are partially addressed. However, REQ-1 (backend main.mo audit and fixes) shows no evidence of any backend file changes.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Diagnose and fix the backend main.mo actor — verify all query and update methods are correctly defined, publicly exposed, return expected types, with no runtime traps, missing stable variables, or broken upgrade paths.",
      "reason": "The diff shows no changes to any backend file (e.g., backend/main.mo or any .mo file). The fix was entirely done on the frontend by bypassing the broken actor initialization. No evidence of backend inspection, compilation verification, or stable variable audit.",
