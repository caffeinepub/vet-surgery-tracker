The project_state.json records AR-1 (mapped to REQ-1) as 'pending', indicating the publish action has not been completed. The file changes appear to be code/feature changes rather than a production publish action. No evidence of the draft version being promoted to a live/published production environment is present in the diff.",

      "reason": "The project_state.json explicitly marks AR-1 (REQ-1) as 'status: pending', meaning the publish has not been completed. There is no evidence in the diff of a production deployment or promotion action. Instead, the diff contains code changes to backend/main.mo and frontend files, which contradicts the non-goal of introducing no new features or code changes during this publish step.",
