  "summary": "The diff modifies `frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts` to fix a race condition in the `enabled` condition (removing `!isFetching` guard), which addresses REQ-1's data-fetching regression. However, there is no evidence that `DashboardView.tsx` or `CasesListView.tsx` were modified to fix component-level loading/error/success state handling as required by REQ-2. The file summary for `CasesListView.tsx` mentions an empty state improvement, but the actual component file was not listed as modified in the diff. No changes to `DashboardView.tsx` are evidenced at all.",
  "missing_requirements": [

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Verify that DashboardView.tsx and CasesListView.tsx correctly consume the cases query result from useQueries.ts — ensuring they handle loading, error, and success states properly — and fix any component-level issues that may prevent cases from rendering even when the query returns data.",
      "reason": "Neither DashboardView.tsx nor CasesListView.tsx appear in the modified files list of the diff. The diff only modifies useQueries.ts, frontend-file-summaries.txt, and project_state.json. No evidence of loading indicator, error message, or CaseCard rendering fixes in either view component.",
