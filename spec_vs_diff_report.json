  "summary": "The diff addresses both REQ-1 (cases list regression) and REQ-2 (broken app logo). REQ-2 is clearly fixed in App.tsx by updating the logo src to the correct asset path. REQ-1 is partially addressed via filtering.ts changes, but there is limited direct evidence of fixes to CasesListView, search logic, or query hooks that caused the 'No cases found' regression. The frontend-file-summaries.txt mentions CasesListView uses correct filter function names, suggesting the fix may be present but the actual CasesListView.tsx diff content is not shown.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Restore the cases list display so that existing cases are visible in the Cases view by auditing and fixing CasesListView, filtering, search, and query hooks.",
      "reason": "The diff shows changes to filtering.ts but does not include the actual content of CasesListView.tsx, useQueries.ts changes related to case fetching, or search.ts fixes. The file summary mentions CasesListView uses correct types and function names, but no direct diff evidence confirms the root cause of the 'No cases found' regression was identified and fixed in the view or query layer.",
