  "summary": "The diff implements all five requirements. A WeeklyCalendarView component with 7-column grid, week navigation, date-range header, and empty-state placeholders was added. A CalendarCaseCard showing Pet Name, MRN, species icon, presenting complaint, task status icons, and completed-case shading was added. DashboardView was modified to include a toggle (defaulting to calendar view) and to wire up the new components. Supporting utility functions (calendarUtils.ts) handle week computation, day filtering, and formatting. All REQ-1 through REQ-5 acceptance criteria appear to be satisfied.",
