  "summary": "The diff addresses REQ-1 (Dashboard empty state), REQ-2 (CasesListView empty state), and partially touches REQ-3 (agent warning). REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear implemented with empty state UI including Stethoscope icons and 'Add First Case' CTAs. REQ-3 is mentioned in file summaries but no direct evidence of the createActor fix is visible in the diff.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Resolve the duplicate agent initialization warning by ensuring createActor is called with either agent or agentOptions, not both simultaneously.",
      "reason": "The diff modifies useQueries.ts (query logic) and view components, but no file in the diff shows a change to how createActor is invoked or how agent/agentOptions are passed. The file-summaries.txt describes useQueries.ts changes as fixing null-actor throws, not the duplicate agent warning. The constrained file useActor.ts is not modified. No evidence of the createActor call being updated to remove the duplicate agentOptions.",
