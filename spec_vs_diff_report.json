  "summary": "The diff modifies useQueries.ts to restore Version 93 data-fetching logic by adding isAuthenticated checks to enabled conditions and setting staleTime: 0 and refetchOnMount: true on useGetAllCases and useGetDashboard. The file summary also confirms CasesListView.tsx and DashboardView.tsx are present. The changes appear targeted at the data-fetching layer as required, without altering backend, unrelated UI, or immutable frontend paths.",
