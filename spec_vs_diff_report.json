  "summary": "The diff implements most of the requested requirements. REQ-1 through REQ-4 and REQ-6 are clearly addressed. REQ-5 (increase font size in CalendarCaseCard) is questionable — the card uses 'text-sm' classes which may not represent an increase over the previous version. No larger font size classes are evident for the main content text.",

      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "In CalendarCaseCard, increase the font size of all text (pet name, last name, complaint, and any other displayed text) to improve readability on the calendar view.",
      "reason": "The CalendarCaseCard uses 'text-sm' for pet name and complaint text. There is no evidence that font sizes were increased relative to a previous version — 'text-sm' is a small Tailwind class and does not indicate a deliberate upsize. No larger classes such as text-base or text-lg are used for the main content text.",
