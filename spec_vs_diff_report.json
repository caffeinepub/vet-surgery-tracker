  "summary": "Both REQ-10 and REQ-11 appear to be implemented in the diff. REQ-10 is addressed by adding <meta name='mobile-web-app-capable' content='yes'> to frontend/index.html alongside the existing apple-mobile-web-app-capable tag. REQ-11 is addressed by updating frontend/public/manifest.json to reference two PNG icons at 192x192 and 512x512 sizes, removing the .ico reference. However, the actual PNG image files are not present in the diff (no added files listed), which may mean the images were not included in the changeset.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "PNG icon image files (app-icon-192.dim_192x192.png and app-icon.dim_512x512.png) must actually exist in the assets/generated directory for the manifest and HTML references to resolve without errors",
      "reason": "The diff shows no added files, yet both manifest.json and index.html reference /assets/generated/app-icon-192.dim_192x192.png and /assets/generated/app-icon.dim_512x512.png. Without these image files being present, the manifest icon error would persist at runtime.",
