  "summary": "All three requirements are substantially implemented. REQ-1 (IconHisto side-view microscope), REQ-2 (IconLabs test tube), and REQ-3 (CalendarCaseCard clickable navigation) are all present in the diff. One minor gap exists for REQ-3: the card accepts an onNavigateToCase callback prop but there is no evidence in the diff that the parent calendar/weekly view component passes this prop or wires it to actual navigation to CasesListView with the case identifier highlighted.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Navigation passes the case identifier so the Cases view can scroll to or highlight the relevant case, and clicking the card actually navigates to the Cases (CasesListView) page.",
      "reason": "CalendarCaseCard accepts an onNavigateToCase prop and calls it on click, but the diff shows no changes to the parent calendar or weekly view component that would wire up this callback to actual navigation logic toward CasesListView with a highlighted or focused case. Without the parent passing this prop, clicking the card does nothing.",
