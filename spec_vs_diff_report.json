  "summary": "All four requirements appear to be implemented in the diff. REQ-1 (compact cards) is addressed in CaseCard.tsx with reduced padding (px-3 py-2) and smaller font sizes. REQ-2 (+ New Case button in header) is implemented in App.tsx with the button in the sticky top nav header. REQ-3 (species silhouette icons) is implemented via a SpeciesIcon component in CaseCard.tsx using the three image assets. REQ-4 (include completed cases in search) is implemented in CaseFormDialog.tsx with a comment explicitly noting 'no completed-case filtering applied here'. One minor concern: REQ-3 specifies a randomly chosen animal silhouette for Other species, but the implementation always uses 'other-animal-silhouette.dim_64x64.png' without any randomization logic.",

      "reason": "The SpeciesIcon component in CaseCard.tsx always renders the same 'other-animal-silhouette.dim_64x64.png' for Other species with no randomization logic. The AC explicitly states a random animal silhouette should be shown for Other species cases.",
