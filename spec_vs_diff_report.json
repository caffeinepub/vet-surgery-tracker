Presenting complaint is shown on CaseCard; color-coded icons are added to checklist.ts, CaseCard, and ChecklistEditor; and a PDF export button with landscape table layout is added to both DashboardView and CasesListView. However, the PDF report is missing several required columns (age, surgery date, attending clinician).",
