  "summary": "The diff modifies backend/main.mo and several frontend files. The backend changes appear to address REQ-1 (actor method correctness). Frontend changes touch App.tsx (REQ-4), useQueries.ts (REQ-2), and CasesListView.tsx (REQ-3). However, DashboardView.tsx is not modified per the diff, meaning REQ-3's requirement to audit and fix the Dashboard page for loading/error states and blank-page prevention is not evidenced. The frontend-file-summaries.txt describes useQueries.ts changes but does not include an entry for DashboardView.tsx.",

      "requirement": "Audit DashboardView.tsx to ensure it correctly consumes React Query hooks, handles loading and error states, and never renders a blank page when data is unavailable. Add or fix error boundary/fallback UI for fetch failures.",
