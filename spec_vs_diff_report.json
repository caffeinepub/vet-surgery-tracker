  "summary": "The diff modifies several frontend files related to workflow icons and case rendering (WorkflowIcon.tsx, CaseCard.tsx, ChecklistEditor.tsx, filtering.ts, search.ts, useQueries.ts, CaseEditDialog.tsx, openTasksCalculation.ts, and supporting files). The changes appear to stabilize the WorkflowIcon component with safe null-checks, fix checklist/task field accessors in CaseCard, and maintain proper data fetching in useQueries.ts. However, the diff does not include changes to CasesListView.tsx or DashboardView.tsx, which are explicitly called out in REQ-1 as files to investigate and potentially fix. Without seeing those files changed or confirmed unchanged-and-correct, it is unclear whether the blank list regression on both pages is fully addressed.",

REQ-1 explicitly names both files as targets for investigation and fixing of the blank list regression.
