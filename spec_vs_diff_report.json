  "summary": "The diff shows that REQ-1 (New Case button in CasesListView.tsx) is clearly implemented. REQ-2 (CaseFormDialog.tsx full functionality) is referenced in the file summaries as restored but the actual CaseFormDialog.tsx diff content is not directly shown — only its summary entry confirms it exists with the required features. The CasesListView.tsx diff confirms the button and dialog wiring. Overall both requirements appear addressed based on available evidence.",
