# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the app icon/favicon with the user-provided image showing a black dog and orange cat with a surgical scalpel.

**Planned changes:**
- Save the user-uploaded image as the favicon in frontend/public/
- Update index.html to reference the new favicon
- Ensure the app icon displays correctly in the browser

**User-visible outcome:** The app displays the new custom icon (black dog and orange cat with surgical scalpel on blue background) in the browser tab and bookmarks.
