# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Set default sort order to Arrival Date (Oldest First) on both Dashboard and Cases pages, and increase MRN font size in case cards and lists.

**Planned changes:**
- Set default sort order to Arrival Date (Oldest First) on Dashboard page load
- Set default sort order to Arrival Date (Oldest First) on Cases page load
- Preserve existing manual sort control functionality on both pages
- Increase MRN font size in Dashboard case cards
- Increase MRN font size in Cases page list items

**User-visible outcome:** Cases are automatically sorted by Arrival Date (Oldest First) when loading Dashboard or Cases pages, with manual sort controls still available. MRN numbers are displayed in a larger, more prominent font size across both pages.
