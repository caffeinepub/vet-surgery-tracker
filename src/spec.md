# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Allow users to select which tasks to track when creating a new surgery case.

**Planned changes:**
- Add seven task checkboxes to the case creation form (Discharge Notes, pDVM Notified, Labs, Histo, Surgery Report, Imaging, Culture)
- Set default checked state for Discharge Notes and pDVM Notified; others default unchecked
- Store only the selected tasks in the case data
- Display only the selected tasks as checkboxes on the case card for completion tracking

**User-visible outcome:** When creating a new case, users can choose which tasks to track by checking/unchecking boxes. Only the selected tasks will appear on the case card as items to complete.
