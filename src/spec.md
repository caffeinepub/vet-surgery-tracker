## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the current app logo and favicon with the user-provided image featuring a black dog and orange cat with a surgical scalpel.

**Planned changes:**
- Update favicon files to use the new logo image
- Update all references to the logo throughout the application

**User-visible outcome:** The app displays the new custom logo (black dog and orange cat with scalpel on blue background) in the browser tab and anywhere the app logo appears.
