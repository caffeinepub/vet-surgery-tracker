# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the “Presenting Complaint” on case cards stand out more in the main case list view.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the CaseCard UI to render non-empty Presenting Complaint text inside a visually distinct blue box (blue border with subtle blue background fill), similar in prominence to the existing emphasized Notes styling.
- Ensure the new Presenting Complaint styling is readable and consistent in both light and dark themes, without changing the “Presenting Complaint” label text.

**User-visible outcome:** In the main case list, cases with a Presenting Complaint show it highlighted in a blue bordered/filled box on the case card, making it easier to spot at a glance.
