# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix task selection workflow during case creation and improve date field formatting with auto-advance behavior.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix task selection so checked items during case creation appear as unchecked checkboxes in "Remaining Tasks" on the case card
- Set default checkbox states: Discharge Notes (checked), pDVM Notified (checked), Labs (unchecked), Histo (unchecked), Surgery Report (unchecked), Imaging (unchecked), Culture (unchecked)
- Change all date fields to MM/DD/YYYY format with auto-advance to next field when date entry is complete

**User-visible outcome:** Users can select tasks during case creation that properly appear as incomplete tasks on case cards, default task selections reduce repetitive clicking, and date entry becomes faster with consistent formatting and automatic field navigation.
