# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Enable direct navigation from Dashboard task groups to specific case cards in the Cases list view.

**Planned changes:**
- Make each case task group in the Dashboard clickable
- Implement navigation that switches to the Cases list view and scrolls to the target case card
- Add visual affordance (hover state, pointer cursor) to indicate clickable case task groups
- Highlight the target case card when navigated to from the Dashboard

**User-visible outcome:** Users can click on any case's task section in the Dashboard to instantly jump to that specific case card in the Cases list, with the card highlighted for easy identification.
