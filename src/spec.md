# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update sex field display format, rename the application to SurgiPaw, and add a dashboard showing open tasks across all surgery cases.

**Planned changes:**
- Change sex field display on Case Card to show 'Female', 'Female Spayed', 'Male', or 'Male Neutered'
- Rename application from 'Surgery Case Log' to 'SurgiPaw' in page title, manifest, and all branding
- Create a new Dashboard view that lists all open tasks and displays a total count

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see the updated sex format on case cards, the application will be branded as SurgiPaw, and they can access a new dashboard that provides a quick overview of all open tasks across their surgery cases with a total count.
