  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all three requirements (REQ-3, REQ-4, REQ-5). A new custom hook `useSpeechRecognition` was created to encapsulate Web Speech API functionality, and the CaseFormDialog was modified to integrate the microphone button with toggle behavior. The button is positioned correctly, uses appropriate icons (Mic/MicOff), and automatically processes transcripts through the existing parseStructuredText function when recording stops. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the diff evidence.",
