  "summary": "The diff implements forced light mode across the app by wrapping all App render branches in a `ThemeProvider` configured for light theme only, removing/preventing any `dark` class on `html`, and setting `color-scheme: light` in global CSS and `index.html`. No explicit BuildRequest requirements appear to be missing based on the provided diff summary.",
