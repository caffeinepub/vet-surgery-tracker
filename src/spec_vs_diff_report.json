  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements: REQ-1 (sex display format), REQ-2 (app rename to SurgiPaw), and REQ-3 (dashboard with open tasks). All acceptance criteria appear to be met with appropriate backend schema changes, frontend display logic, navigation integration, and real-time updates via React Query.",

The diff shows backend/main.mo changed the Sex type to use #maleNeutered and #femaleSpayed instead of the required #neutered and #spayed values.",
