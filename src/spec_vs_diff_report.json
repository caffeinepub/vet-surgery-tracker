  "summary": "The implementation fully satisfies all three requirements. A sorting control UI component (CasesSortControl) was added with all four requested sort options, sorting logic was implemented in a dedicated sorting module using arrivalDate and uncompleted checklist items, and the sorting persists correctly across search, create, update, and checklist toggle operations.",

      "reason": "The sorting.ts file implements a secondary sort by arrival date (newest first) when sorting by open tasks to ensure stable ordering. This tie-breaking behavior was not specified in the BuildRequest.",
