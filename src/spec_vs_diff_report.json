  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to backend/main.mo and several frontend files (App.tsx, AuthContext.tsx, LoginButton.tsx, etc.), which align with reverting to Version 67. However, the diff is heavily truncated, making full verification impossible. The BuildRequest requires restoring exact Version 67 state and removing AuthProvider-related changes from Versions 68-71. Without seeing complete file contents or evidence of what Version 67 actually looked like, I cannot definitively confirm all requirements are met or identify hallucinated features. The project_state.json shows both requirements as 'pending' status, suggesting implementation may be incomplete.",

The files are truncated, and there is no reference baseline showing what Version 67 actually contained. The project_state.json shows AR-1 (linked to REQ-1) with status 'pending', suggesting the requirement may not be fully implemented. Without Version 67 baseline or completion evidence, restoration cannot be confirmed.",

Without seeing the actual changes or confirmation that AuthProvider wrapper was removed, this requirement cannot be verified as complete.
