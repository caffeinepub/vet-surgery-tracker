  "summary": "The diff implements most of the requested requirements for fixing voice recording and Parse and Fill functionality. Voice recording now transcribes to the Quick Fill text box (REQ-1), parsing logic has been significantly enhanced to extract all 9 case fields (REQ-2), and date parsing has been improved with multiple format handlers (REQ-3). However, the implementation shows incomplete date parsing for spoken number sequences like 'twelve fifteen twenty twenty four' - the code adds helper functions but lacks the full word-to-number conversion logic explicitly mentioned in REQ-3 acceptance criteria.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Parser converts spoken dates like 'twelve fifteen twenty twenty four' to 12/15/2024 and handles dates spoken as 'one two one five two zero two four' to 12/15/2024",
      "reason": "While parseDate function was enhanced with multiple format handlers, there is no evidence of word-to-number conversion logic (e.g., 'twelve' → '12', 'twenty twenty four' → '2024') in the diff. The parseStructuredText.ts file is truncated but shows no parseSpokenNumbers or similar helper that would convert spoken number words to digits.",
