  "summary": "The diff implements comprehensive actor availability checks, error handling, and retry mechanisms across frontend components. Backend migration infrastructure was added. All requirements appear to be addressed with defensive coding patterns, loading states, and user-friendly error messaging.",

      "description": "Backend migration system (backend/migration.mo) with OpenAIConfig state transformation",
