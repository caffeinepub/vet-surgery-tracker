  "summary": "REQ-13 appears to be implemented via updates to CaseCard to render Presenting Complaint in a visually distinct blue bordered/filled section with light/dark theme classes. However, the diff is truncated, so some acceptance criteria (e.g., unchanged label text) cannot be fully verified from the provided excerpts. Several additional changes (checklist persistence/search and task badge styling) appear to have been made beyond the requested UI emphasis update.",
